        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "  - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library used for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - N-dimensional arrays: The ndarray object is faster and more compact than Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Mathematical operations: You can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly on arrays without writing loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Broadcasting and vectorization: These features allow operations between arrays of different shapes efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Integration: Works seamlessly with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Why it’s widely used:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It’s the foundation of data analysis and machine learning in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It provides C-speed performance through optimized code.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It simplifies mathematical computations and enables matrix manipulation, which is essential for scientific applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "  - Broadcasting is a method that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. Instead of creating multiple copies of smaller arrays, NumPy “stretches” or replicates them in memory to match the shape of the larger array — without actually copying data, making it memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Rules of Broadcasting:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If arrays have a different number of dimensions, the smaller one is padded with ones on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If the sizes of dimensions do not match, NumPy compares them:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If one of the dimensions is 1, it can be stretched to match the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If neither matches, it throws an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     - import numpy as np\n",
        "     - a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
        "     - b = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])\n",
        "     - print(a + b)\n",
        "   - Output:\n",
        "     - [[11 12 13]\n",
        "     - [21 22 23]\n",
        "     - [31 32 33]]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   - NumPy automatically broadcasted the smaller array a to match the shape of b.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "  - A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure provided by the Pandas library, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - import pandas as pd\n",
        "   - data = {\n",
        "     - 'Name': ['Raj', 'Ravi', 'Simran'],\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Three-step process:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Split: Divide data into groups based on some criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Apply: Perform a function (sum, mean, count, etc.) on each group.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Combine: Merge the results into a new DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
